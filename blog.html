    <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <p>food waste is food that is not eaten. The causes of food waste and ours or loss are numerous during production ghout the food system, 1, processing, distribution retail and food waste servlice sales, and consumption. Overall, about one third of the world's food is thrown away.

<mark>A 2021 meta-analysis that did not include food lest during production, by the United National Environment Programme found that food waste was a Challenge in all countries at all levels of economic development.</mark> The analysis estimated that global food waste. was 931 million tonnes of food waste (about 121 kg per capita) across three sectors: <mark>61 percent from food serving and 13 percent from retail."

food loss and waste is a major part of import of agriculture on Telimate the change (it amounts to 3.3 billion tone of come emission annually) and their other environmental issues, such as land use, water use and loss of biodiversity.</mark> Prevention of food waste is the highest pir priority, and</p>
    <p id="moreText">and when prevention is not penible, the food waste hierarily ranks the food waste treatment options from preffered to least preferred based on this rejetive environment. <mark>at imparte heure pathways of surplus food intended for human consumption, such as food devation, is the next day but Strategy after prevention, followed by animal feed wyaling of nutrients and energy followed by the least preferred estion, landfill, which is a major sousie of greenhouse gas mechame.</mark> other considerations include unreclaimed phosphorus in food waste leading to further phosphate mining redning food waste in all parts of the food system is important part of reducing the environment import of agriculture, by redwing the total amount of water land and other resources used

     <h1>FOOD PROCESSING</h1>
     <p>when food is stored, considered amounts are wasted because of pests and microorganisms.<mark> This problem ouers in countrice where it is both relatively hot, and humid. These conditions boat the growth of pests and micoorganiems.</mark> Extreme temperature, humidity or mitoorganisms also influence the nutritional value, calosti nalue and edibility waste. I el crops and awount for food qualitative loosel are more difficult to assess than quantitative ones. more too losses our because the food is not weight handled correctly, or because it loses weight or volume.</p>

      <h1>FOOD WASTE MANAGEMENT</h1>
      <p><mark>Food waste management is the process of reducing, recovering, and recycling food that is not consumed by humans or animals.</mark> It aims to prevent food loss and waste, which can have negative impacts on the environment, economy, and society.</p>
      <p id="moreText1">The paper aims at explaining the issue of food waste and describing approaches to the reduction of this problem. The introduction contains a general overview of the paper and presents the components included in the study.<mark> Research contains an expanded definition of the ‘food waste’ concept along with its presence in foodservice organizations. Further, food waste management and prevention initiatives to be employed in the foodservice industry are discussed. The challenges and opportunities of food waste mitigation are analyzed. In the conclusion, the main points of the paper are summarized.</mark> The research presents a brief but substantial analysis of the food waste problem and approaches to its elimination.</p>

      <h1>FOOD WASTE REDUCTION</h1>
      <p>Reducing food waste is crucial for environmental sustainability and ensuring efficient resource use. Here are several methods to help reduce food waste at different stages of the food supply chain and in households:
Meal Planning:
Plan your meals in advance.
Create a shopping list based on planned meals to avoid impulse purchases.
Storage Practices:
</mark>Properly store perishable items to extend their shelf life.
Use airtight containers to keep food fresh.
Be aware of the shelf life of different products and consume them before they expire.
First In, First Out (FIFO):</mark>
Practice FIFO in both your pantry and refrigerator. Use older items before newer ones.
Portion Control:
Serve and consume reasonable portions to avoid leftovers.
Teach and encourage portion control, especially in restaurants.</p>
<p id="moreText2">Understand Expiration Dates:
Understand the difference between "sell by," "use by," and "best by" dates.
Many products are still safe to consume after the expiration date.
Donate Surplus Food:
Contribute excess food to local food banks or charities.
Consider joining food-sharing platforms to connect with individuals or organizations in need.
Composting:
Compost kitchen scraps and food waste to reduce landfill impact.
Set up a composting system at home or support community composting initiatives.
Educational Campaigns:
<mark>Raise awareness about food waste through educational programs.
Encourage responsible consumption and disposal practices.
Technology Solutions:</mark>
Use mobile apps to track food inventory and expiration dates.
Employ smart storage solutions that help monitor and manage food freshness.
Recovery of Imperfect Produce:
<mark>Support initiatives that utilize "ugly" or imperfect produce to reduce waste.
Collaboration Along the Supply Chain:
Encourage collaboration between producers, retailers, and consumers to streamline the supply chain and reduce waste at each stage.</mark></p>
